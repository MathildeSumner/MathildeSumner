        <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions,
            and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread public interest. 
            Swift signed with Big Machine Records in 2005, starting as a country pop singer with her first two albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). 
            Their singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me" were crossover successes on country and pop radio formats. She experimented 
            with rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later recalibrating her image from country to pop music with the synth-pop album 1989 (2014). The 
            ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017); the albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are Never Ever Getting 
            Back Together", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood", and "Look What You Made Me Do". </p>
            
        <p>Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie 
            folk styles in the 2020 sister-albums Folklore and Evermore and subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024), while also re-recording 
            four of her albums under the (Taylor's Version) subtitle,[a] after an ownership dispute with Big Machine. The albums garnered the U.S. number one songs "Cruel Summer", 
            "Cardigan", "Willow", "All Too Well", "Anti-Hero", "Is It Over Now?", and "Fortnight" in the 2020s. Her sixth concert tour, the Eras Tour (2023–2024), and its accompanying 
            concert film are respectively the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time; Swift became the first billionaire with music as the main source of income and the 
            highest-grossing female touring act. </p>
            
        <p>Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists with an estimated global sale of 200 million records. Seven of her albums have opened with over one million pure sales 
            in a week. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard, and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to 
            have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 39 Billboard Music Awards, and 30 
            MTV Video Music Awards; she has won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year, and the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year at 
            least four times each.</p>

        <h2 id="Life and career">Life and career </h2>
            <h3 id="Musical styles">Musical styles</h3>
                <p>Swift's early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks, and Keith Urban's country crossover 
                    sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues. She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from 
                    Taylor Swift to Red. The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences; 
                    Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock. Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction 
                    and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots. </p>

                <p>After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by 
                    the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna. 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum 
                    machines. Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums; Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences; and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, 
                    and folk rock. When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity, but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's 
                    artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.</p>
                    
                <p>Her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore explore alternative and indie styles of rock and folk, and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads. 
                    The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments. Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.
                    Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, subdued synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns.</p>
                    
                <p>With continuous musical reinventions, Swift was described by Time and the BBC as a musical "chameleon." Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a "bait-and-switch 
                    maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop." Clash wrote that she has the versatility to "no longer [...] be defined by any genre or sound label." According to Ann Powers, Swift's 
                    sound is genre-agnostic, blending and "reconfiguring" elements of country, R&B, indie pop, and hip hop.</p>
            <h3 id="Voice">Voice</h3>
                <p>Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range and a generally soft and breathy timbre that Rolling Stone deemed versatile. Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers. Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized "intimacy over power and nuance" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience—a style that they labeled "conversational." According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow."

                    On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production. Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody. She uses her lower register vocals extensively in "Cardigan" and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as "breathy and bright" and the lower register as "full and dark."
                    
                    Reviews in The New York Times, Variety, and The Atlantic were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums. She ranked 102nd on Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: "A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument." Laura Snapes of The Guardian said that Swift's "vocal directness" enables her to express wide-ranging feelings, highlighting some trademarks such as "yo-yoing vocal yelp" and "climactic, processed cri de coeur." Amanda Petrusich praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics.
            <h3 id="Songwriting">Songwriting</h3>

                Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations. She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them. Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton; 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette; Joni Mitchell; and Fall Out Boy. She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs. Her literary influences included the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson; the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.
                
                In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across." Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life. Her "diaristic" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody. On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes. She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red, and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989. Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame, and Lover detailed her realization of the "full spectrum of love." Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship, alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism. She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures.
                
                Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music, although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged. Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture." NPR dubbed Swift "a master of the vernacular in her lyrics," remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because "the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures." Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary." Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist. Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.
                
                On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives. She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry. Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success. According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with "precision and devastation" on Evermore. Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from "teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult."
                
                Swift divides her writing into three types: "quill lyrics," songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; "fountain pen lyrics," based on modern and vivid storylines; and "glitter gel pen lyrics," which are lively and frivolous. Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album. Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that "no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today." The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times, and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022. Swift has also published two original poems: "Why She Disappeared" and "If You're Anything Like Me."
                
                Swift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications. Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare among her peers. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is "a profoundly old-fashioned artist," whose songs "tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings. Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs, earning her the title "Queen of Bridges" from Time. Mojo dubbed her "a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor." Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate, philosopher, and bard.

                Swift commands large audiences on stage without having to rely on dance. According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses "a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting", irrespective of whether she is "plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers." In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a "preternaturally skilled" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding "she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen." In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her "seemingly endless stamina" on the Eras Tour, and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship "unparalleled."
                
                Swift's concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology, and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007. Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar; acoustic guitar; piano; and sometimes twelve-string guitar, six-string banjo, or ukulele. Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection. Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains "integral to her singer-songwriter origins." Chris Willman of Variety called Swift "pop's most approachable superstar," and the 21st century's most popular performer.
            <h3 id="Video and film">Video and film</h3>

                Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process. She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for "Mean" in 2011 and co-directed the music video for "Mine" with Roman White the year before. In an interview, White said that Swift "was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting, and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes."
                
                From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement. She worked with American Express for the "Blank Space" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015. Swift produced the music video for "Bad Blood" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.
                
                Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media, starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour. She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles "Me!" with Dave Meyers, and "You Need to Calm Down" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and "Lover" with Drew Kirsch, but first ventured into sole direction with the video for "The Man" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction). After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film, which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director. Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.</p>
